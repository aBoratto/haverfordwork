<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my webpage about my favorite music. My goal is expose you to the greatest music of all time form manny different genres.<br>
I divided the music I listen to into 4 genres. Rock and Roll which will consist of music from the modern era of Rock<br>
with bands like Coldplay all the back to the 70's and 80's with bands like ACDC and Guns and Roses. The second genre is Old School Rap, consisting of rap songs that were released begore 2000. You can expect to see artis like 2Pac, Biggie and the Wu-Tang Clan. Third we have Modern Day Rap.
